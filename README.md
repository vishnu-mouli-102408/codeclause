# Airline Reservation System

The Airline Reservation System is a Java-based project that facilitates booking and managing flight reservations for an airline. The system provides a user-friendly interface for customers to search for available flights, reserve seats, and manage their bookings. Additionally, airline administrators can access an administrative panel to manage flights, view reservations, and perform various administrative tasks.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: Customers can create an account, and registered users can log in to access the reservation system.

2. **Flight Search**: Users can search for available flights based on the departure and destination cities, date, and other preferences.

3. **Flight Booking**: Customers can book seats on available flights.

4. **Seat Selection**: During the booking process, users can select their preferred seats from an interactive seat map.

5. **Flight Status**: Users can check the status of their booked flights, including departure time, arrival time, and any potential delays.

6. **Booking Modification and Cancellation**: Users can modify their bookings or cancel their reservations (with applicable terms and conditions).

7. **Administrative Panel**: The airline administrators have access to a secure administrative panel with the following features:
   - Add, edit, or remove flights from the system.
   - View and manage reservations made by customers.
   - Generate reports on flight occupancy and revenue.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI)
- MySQL database for storing flight and user information
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions
- Maven for project build and dependency management
